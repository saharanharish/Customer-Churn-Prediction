# Customer-Driven Prediction and Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing a **telecommunication retail dataset** to understand customer behavior and predict churn.  
The goal is to derive business insights that can help in decision-making, customer retention, and overall business growth.  

Key highlights:
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** in SQL Server.  
- Built a **Power BI Dashboard** to summarize customer data and churn patterns.  
- Implemented a **Machine Learning model** to predict churn likelihood.  
- Extracted **business insights** to support strategic decisions.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. **Data Preparation (SQL Server):** Imported the raw dataset into SQL Server, performed data cleaning by handling null values, replacing inconsistent entries, and formatting fields for consistency.  
2. **Data Integration (Power BI):** Connected SQL Server with Power BI to seamlessly fetch the cleaned dataset for visualization and reporting.  
3. **Exploratory Analysis (Power BI):** Designed interactive dashboards to analyze customer demographics, service usage patterns, and churn distribution across segments.  
4. **Model Development (Python):** Trained a Machine Learning model (classification) to predict customer churn using features such as tenure, services, and billing details.  
5. **Insight Generation (Business Strategy):** Combined dashboard findings and model predictions to derive customer retention strategies, such as targeting high-risk segments and offering personalized interventions.
